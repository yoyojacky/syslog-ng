/**
 * This function escapes an unsanitized input (e.g. that can contain binary
 * characters, and produces an escaped format that can be deescaped in need,
 * which is guaranteed to be utf8 clean.  The major difference between
 * "binary" and "text" form is that the receiver is able to cope with \xXX
 * sequences that can incorporate invalid utf8 sequences when decoded.  With
 * "text" format, we never embed anything that would become not valid utf8
 * when decoded.
 *
 * This is basically meant to be used when sending data to
 * 8 bit clean receivers, e.g. syslog-ng or WELF.
 *
 * Here are the rules that the routine follows:
 *   - well-known control characters are escaped (0x0a as \n and so on)
 *   - other control characters as \xXX
 *   - backslash is escaped as \\
 *   - any additional characters (only ASCII is supported) as \<char>
 *   - invalid utf8 sequences are converted to \xXX
 *   - utf8 characters are reproduced as is
